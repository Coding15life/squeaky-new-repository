### Hey! How are you?

This repository has been used for me to get used to Github, as I'm still quite lost on using Github :D. Just to introduce myself, my name is Javier, and I'm embarking on this journey to improve my frontend development skills. I will include many more projects in the future, so stay tuned until then.

I'm writing this because I'm reading a blog on using Github in the FreeCodeCamp website, so I just wanted to follow along.

My mood:

> Happy :)

My favorite color:

> Red

Thanks you so much for reading. I'll try to update this when I'm free!
